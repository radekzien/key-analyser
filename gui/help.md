#### What is the Subdominant, Dominant, and relative major/minor?  
These are keys that are closely connected to the detected key:  
- **Dominant** - The closest neighbouring key in one direction.
- **Subdominant** - The closest neighbouring key in the opposite direction.  


These two keys share many notes with the detected key and have a particularly strong relationship to it.

- **Relative Major/Minor** - This key shares the exact same notes as the detected key, but has a different tonal centre.
